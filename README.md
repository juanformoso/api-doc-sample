api-doc sample application
==========================

This is a sample application that shows the standard usage of [api-doc](https://github.com/juanformoso/api-doc)

You'll notice a blank space in the header -- that's because I have less than zero image editing abilities, and was unable to make myself a logo. But check out this [API](http://api.despegar.com) that uses the component and has one.

Quick how to
------------

All you need to do is download it, run it as a Java app, and then use your favorite browser to go to http://localhost:1337

Pendings
--------

I'll find somewhere to host it early this week, so you'll be able to see this app in action

The only method that returns data is /simple, that's because what the app actually returns is not part of the scope of api-doc
